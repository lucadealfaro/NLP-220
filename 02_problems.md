### The Door Swithing Problem

A fun and classic problem to solve with Bayes' theorem is the **Monty Hall problem**. It's a great example because the solution often goes against our initial intuition.

***

### The Problem

Imagine you're on a game show. There are three doors. Behind one door is a car üöó, and behind the other two are goats üêêüêê.

1.  You choose one door, say Door #1.
2.  The host, Monty Hall, who knows what's behind each door, opens one of the other doors, say Door #3, to reveal a goat.
3.  Monty then gives you a choice: you can either **stick** with your original choice (Door #1) or **switch** to the other unopened door (Door #2).

#### Part 1

The question is: **Should you stick or switch?**

Explain your solution using Bayes' theorem.  

#### Part 2

Suppose now that the host has not the faintest idea of where the car is, and opens a door at random (which happens to reveal a goat).  Now, is it better to stick or switch?  Explain.


## The Blood Test

Suppose that there's a very rare disease, that affects only 1 person in 10,000,000 people.  That is very rare indeed! 

To test for the disease, there is a blood test that is 99% accurate.  

1. How many tests are needed to be 90% confident that a person has the disease? 

2. If a person does 5 tests, and 4 come out positive and one negative, what is the probability that the person has the disease? 

## The Card Color Problem

Imagine three cards in a hat:
1.  A **red-red** card (both sides are red).
2.  A **black-black** card (both sides are black).
3.  A **red-black** card (one side is red, the other is black).

You randomly pick one card from the hat and place it on a table. The side facing up is **red**. What is the probability that the other side of the card is also red?
