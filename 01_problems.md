## Problem set 1

Recall the definition of Borel $\sigma$-algebra: 

* **Set:** $X = \mathbb{R}$ (the set of all real numbers).
* **$\sigma$-algebra:** $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$ (the **Borel $\sigma$-algebra**). This is the smallest $\sigma$-algebra that contains all the open intervals $(a, b)$. It includes all the unions, intersections, and complements of intervals, which is essentially every set you'll ever encounter in practice.
* **Measure:** $\mu((a, b)) = b - a$. This is the standard notion of length.

1. Prove that single points $\{x\}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ are Borel sets.

1.  Let $S$ be the set of all real numbers that have at least three 4 in their decimal representation. Is $S$ a Borel set?

1. Let $S$ be the set of all real numbers that have more 4's than 5's in their decimal representation.  Is $S$ a Borel set?
